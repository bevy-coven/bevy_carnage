# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate are recorded here. Versions up to `0.7.0` are described in the
comment block at the top of `Cargo.toml`.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `tools/qa.sh` finishes a round on a default build (#5, `AG-140`). The six `vfx` examples (`carnage`,
  `capture_carnage`, `pooling`, `capture_pooling`, `ribbons`, `capture_ribbons`) stay on its roster but
  run only when `QA_FEATURES` names `vfx`, which also adds it to the build step; otherwise each gets one
  `missing.txt` line naming the feature and the round goes on, where it used to end at the first of them
  with "no built binary". A binary the default build should have made and did not still ends the round.
  A `vfx` binary an earlier build left behind is not run in a round that did not build `vfx`.
- `tools/qa.sh` renders the skinned body: `capture_skinned` is a recorder name, and so is each variant
  `docs/DEMOS.md`'s recipe records (`capture_skinned_break`, `_shirt`, `_through`, `_guard`, `_spray`,
  `_stroll`, `_blows`, `_quiet`), with the same flags; the autopiloted `skinned` example is on the
  windowed list with a key list taken from its own key reads.

### Added

- `tests/qa_roster.rs`: runs `tools/qa.sh` dry and for real against an empty binary directory, and
  holds what it plans and reports to `Cargo.toml` and `examples/`.
