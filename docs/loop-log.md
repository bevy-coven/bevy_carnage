# bevy_carnage — loop log

One entry per iteration of `.omp/commands/build-loop.md`, appended, never rewritten. The next
iteration's number is the last one here plus one. `BACKLOG.md` and `BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md` hold the
pre-loop ticket history (`AG-001` … `AG-139`); the loop's backlog lives at the end of the newest entry
below.

## Iteration 0 — 2026-10-30 — loop setup

Written by the owner's session, not by a pass. Nothing under `src/`, `tests/`, `Cargo.toml` or CI
changed.

- **The command.** `.omp/commands/build-loop.md`, adapted from bevy_stigmergy's. Scratch is
  `/tmp/cN/`, the baseline worktree `~/cN_base` (built into `~/cN_base-target`). The supervisor sets
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`; the binaries are under `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/release/examples/`.
- **The owner's direction, 2026-10-30: this loop learns its look from horror films.** Every pass that
  touches something visible gathers 4-6 practical-effects references (*The Thing*, *Evil Dead*,
  *Hellraiser*, *Re-Animator*, *Terrifier*, *The Fly*, *Saw*, FX-artist pages) with `web_search`, the golem
  MCP's `search_reference_images` and `read`, keeps them under `/tmp/cN/refs/` (never committed unless
  CC0/CC-BY with attribution), writes what each shows into the research note's `## Reference set`, and
  judges its captures beside them in a `magick montage`. The look is replicated procedurally.
- **The gate** (from `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `CLAUDE.md`): `cargo build`, `cargo build --release`,
  `cargo test`, `cargo build --examples`; plus the reproducibility gate (each recorder's digest equal
  across two runs and to the baseline unless meant to move) and the performance gate (`bench_carnage`'s
  `carnage_frame_ms` and `carnage_p99_ms`, median of three, no regression over 5 %). Clippy, rustfmt and
  wasm are not gates (CI runs none; `BACKLOG.md` records 338 standing clippy warning lines).
  `--all-features` is not a gate: `vfx` cannot build until `bevy_hanabi` publishes for Bevy 0.20.
- **Version.** `Cargo.toml` on `main` says `0.7.0` (set in `f6f7bc7`, 2026-10-19). crates.io's newest is
  **`0.5.18`** (`cargo info bevy_carnage`). The repository has **no tags**. So the first pass that
  releases diffs from `f6f7bc7` per the Release block; everything from `0.5.19` to `0.7.0` reaches
  crates.io then. The version history before this loop is the comment block at the top of
  `Cargo.toml`; from here on it is `CHANGELOG.md` (created with an empty `## [Unreleased]`).
- **Issues.** `gh issue list --repo Ladvien/bevy_carnage --state all` is empty: none has ever been
  filed. bevy_emerge's family issue F12 (`#108`, destructible props and damage dials) is closed.

### Ranked backlog for iteration 1

No open issues, so the order is bugs recorded in the repository, then the horror-film reference set,
then measurable items from the code and docs.

1. **Bug, verify first: `preset::tests::a_wound_stains_the_floor_beneath_it`.** `Cargo.toml`'s `0.6.0`
   note says `cargo test` passes except this test, failing the same way on 0.5.64 under Bevy 0.19, and
   CI runs `cargo test`. Done when `cargo test` is green with the test unchanged (a fix in `src/`, not a
   loosened assertion), or, if it already passes, one log line quoting the run.
2. **Match a horror-film reference set: arterial spray.** A pulsed jet whose droplets streak, fan in a
   cone and land on a wall as elongated stains whose aspect ratio follows the impact angle
   (`capture_skinned --through`, `--guard`). Measure: stain count, smallest-to-largest size spread and
   elongation against angle, beside 4-6 wall-splatter stills; the bench digest moves deliberately or not
   at all.
3. **Match a horror-film reference set: pooling and drying.** A pool's radius over time, a crisp rim,
   the dark ring and brown-black crust as it dries, the highlight breaking up as it skins over
   (`capture_skinned --stroll`, `dry_timeline`, `drying`). Measure the sampled sRGB fresh and dry against
   the references and the radius curve against the rheology the pool model cites. (`pooling` and
   `capture_pooling` need `vfx`; see item 6.)
4. **Match a horror-film reference set: wound sheen.** A crater, a laceration and a cut face read wet:
   a specular highlight on the film, a darker lip, walls darker than the floor (`capture_skinned`,
   `capture_flesh`, `laceration_open`, `flaymap_peel`), beside wound-makeup close-ups. Shader-side; WebGL2
   re-checked after `flesh.wesl` changes.
5. **Match a horror-film reference set: fracture debris.** A broken body's pieces read as meat, fat and
   bone with their own blood, and the pieces' size spread looks torn rather than diced
   (`capture_skinned --break`, `explode`, `sever`), beside dismemberment and body-horror stills; every
   piece still closed and manifold by `isomesh`.
6. **`vfx` on Bevy 0.20.** Six examples (`carnage`, `capture_carnage`, `pooling`, `capture_pooling`,
   `ribbons`, `capture_ribbons`) and the GPU spray cannot build until `bevy_hanabi` supports Bevy 0.20.
   Check whether it has published; if so, bump it and make `cargo build --examples --features vfx` pass.
   Done when that command succeeds, or one log line names the newest hanabi and its Bevy requirement.
7. **`CLAUDE.md` says "Bevy 0.19 is pinned" in four rule lists** (and cites `bevy-0.19.1` and
   `bevy_pbr-0.19.0` paths) while the manifest is on `0.20.0`. Re-point every one to the 0.20 source,
   checking each cited line still says what it is cited for. Measure: `grep -c '0\.19' CLAUDE.md` falls to
   the historical mentions only.
8. **Release.** crates.io serves `0.5.18`; `main` is `0.7.0` with no tag. The first pass that changes
   the package and passes the gate publishes (6-hour rule; `cargo publish --dry-run` first, since the
   optional `bevy_hanabi 0.19` dependency targets Bevy 0.19).
